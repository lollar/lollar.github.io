A preview of things to come...
<!--more-->
Hello to all of you who are reading this. I have a lot of opinions, most aren't good, but some are decent I think, and I'm going to expand on those opinions here.

To start I'm going to dive deep into testing Rails applications with RSpec. This will be a multipost series so be sure to check back for more updates. 

Please drop me an email at: mike@lollar.codes if you have any questions.
